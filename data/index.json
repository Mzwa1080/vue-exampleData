  "about": [
    "As a recent graduate from Life Choices Academy, I've developed a strong foundation in full stack web development. Throughout my time at the academy, I honed my skills in various technologies, enabling me to tackle diverse and complex challenges using code. One aspect I particularly enjoyed was assisting my peers on the bugs/issues their had on their Vue.js/Node.js/MySQL queries, Additionally, I discovered a passion for design while using Figma. Not only did these experiences benefit my peers, but it also provided me with numerous ways of solving problems.",
    "Now, I'm eager to apply both my theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience to launch my professional coding career. Initially, I aim to specialize as a front-end developer for the first two years, leveraging my skills to create engaging and user-friendly interfaces. Beyond that, I have a keen interest in transitioning into QA Testing, where I can continue to refine my problem-solving abilities and ensure the quality of software products for the long term.",
    "Outside of coding, I'm deeply passionate about financial markets and trading. You'll often find me absorbed in charts, analyzing strategies, and backtesting market movements. I enjoy using institutional methods to anticipate future market movements and identify potential targets. Additionally, I stay updated on financial news and upcoming events through platforms like CNBC and investing.com."
